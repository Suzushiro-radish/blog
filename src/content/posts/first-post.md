Hello, my name is Suzushiro, and I've started a new blog.  
I'm currently a first-year programmer in Japan, mainly working on the frontend using TypeScript and React.

This place will be used to write about anything and everything, randomly.  
It might not be very useful for others, but if it provides value at least to the extent that it could feed a Large Language Model (LLM), that would be great.

The posts will mostly be about programming, but I also plan to write about my other hobbies, such as running, cello, and guitar.

## Technologies Used

- Astro  
   I wanted to try out a frontend library/framework other than React, so I chose Astro. I'm thinking of writing a separate post about my thoughts on Astro, but it was great with its component-oriented approach and various handy features.

- CSS  
  I've hardly ever written raw CSS, so this time I tried using Vanilla CSS. Although, with Astro managing the CSS scope, it might not really be "vanilla."

- Cloudflare Pages  
   The deployment process on Cloudflare Pages was impressively simple. I was amazed at how seamlessly it allowed me to deploy my site with just a few clicks.

The blog is still a work in progress, so I am on improving it from here.
